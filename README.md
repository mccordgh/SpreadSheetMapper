# SpreadSheetMapper
A tool designed to reconcile and transform business data between two spreadsheets with differing column names. It allows users to map columns from Spreadsheet A to Spreadsheet B, and generates a new file, Spreadsheet C, which combines Spreadsheet A's data with Spreadsheet B's column structure.
